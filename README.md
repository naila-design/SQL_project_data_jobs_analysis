# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data engineer job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs (data is taken from Luke Barousse SQL course, of data analytical jobs in 2023).

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data engineer jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data engineers?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?


# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data engineer positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the top 10 high paying opportunities in the field.

    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short= 'Data Engineer' AND
    job_location= 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10

```

## 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Engineers
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

``` sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short= 'Data Engineer' 
    
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```
The table below highlights the most in-demand skills for Data Engineer roles in 2023.
- **SQL** is the most sought-after skill, confirming its fundamental role in manipulating, managing and querying data in structured environments.
- **Python** is placed just below, and is one of the most used programming language for data engineering thanks to its flexibility, vast ecosystem of libraries (such as Pandas, PySpark) and applicability to data pipelines, automation and machine learning.
- Cloud skills such as **AWS and Azure** reflect the growing migration of data infrastructures towards cloud environments
- **Apache Spark** confirms itself as one of the main technologies for the distributed processing of large volumes of data


| Skill  | Demand Count |
|--------|--------------|
| SQL    | 113,375      |

## 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short= 'Data Engineer' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
